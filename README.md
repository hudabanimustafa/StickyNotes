# Sticky Notes Application

## Overview

This Sticky Notes Application is a personal training project designed to enhance my skills in Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to create, view, and manage sticky notes with customizable titles, content, and colors. This project is part of my ongoing learning journey and aims to apply the concepts of Spring Boot and front-end technologies in a practical way.

## Features

- **Create Sticky Notes**: Add new sticky notes with a title, content, and color.
- **View Sticky Notes**: Display a list of all created sticky notes.
- **Manage Sticky Notes**: Update or delete existing sticky notes.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for building the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for creating the backend RESTful services.
- **Jakarta Persistence (JPA)**: Used for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and database interactions.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database used for development and testing.
- **HTML**: Markup language used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Stylesheet language used for designing and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for adding dynamic functionality to the web pages.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sticky-notes-application.git
   cd sticky-notes-application
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   You can use Maven or Gradle to build the project. For Maven, use:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application using:
   ```bash

   ```
   or by running the `StickyNoteApplication` class directly from your IDE.

4. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the application.

## Front-End

- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure of the sticky notes interface.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the sticky notes and overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used for dynamic interactions, such as adding, updating, and deleting sticky notes.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/notes**: Retrieve a list of all sticky notes.
- **POST /api/notes**: Create a new sticky note.
- **GET /api/notes/{id}**: Retrieve a sticky note by its ID.
- **PUT /api/notes/{id}**: Update an existing sticky note.
- **DELETE /api/notes/{id}**: Delete a sticky note by its ID.
